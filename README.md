# roblox asset downloader

an **asynchronous python tool** for downloading and processing roblox clothing assets (shirts, pants) in bulk.
automatically applies a user-provided template overlay to each asset, so you don’t have to manually edit hundreds of images.

## 🚀 usage

### download individual or multiple assets with automatic template overlay

```python
import asyncio
from module.roblox import AsyncRobloxDownloader

# template dir and runtime dir are different, i'm just using the same folder for simplicity
downloader = AsyncRobloxDownloader(template="./runtime/template.png", runtime_dir="./runtime/", max_concurrent=10)

async def main():
    # download single or multiple assets
    await downloader.download_assets("9924398681")
    await downloader.download_assets(["9884494638", "9884500531"])

    # download group items (default 10, or specify limit)
    await downloader.download_group_items(9137704)
    await downloader.download_group_items(9137704, limit=20)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

### download all items from a group store

```python
# automatically applies template overlay to every downloaded asset
await downloader.download_group_items(33054845, limit=50)
```

all assets are saved in `runtime/assets/` with your template applied automatically — no manual photoshop work needed.
